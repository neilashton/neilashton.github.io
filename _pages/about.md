I'm a Distinguished Engineer and CAE Product Architect at NVIDIA, with a specific focus on Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE). Prior to NVIDIA, I was the WW Tech Lead for CAE at Amazon Web Services. I am also a Fellow of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Previous to these positions I was a Senior Researcher within the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. I also worked in Formula 1 with the Lotus F1 team (now Renault F1) and I worked with Formula 1 Management and the FIA on the 2021 technical regulation changes and I was also a core part of the British Cycling 2020 Tokyo Olympics bike development program.
I'm passionate about explaining science and engineering to the general public and also host a podcast which you can listen on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/4muRLrJ9Pxglw0RsPgx2gb?si=2ad43f70bad14edb) or watch on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFFbscxlXPiTNRulk8sOwRQ).
