Part of the HPC leadership team to decide on key new HPC/ML-related services, hardware, software and regularly work with Director and VP-level within AWS. This role focuses on developing the strategy on what products and technologies we build to help customers wanting to do computational engineering (CFD, FEA, ML, CAD, PLM etc) on AWS whether it's a large enterprise, startup or public-sector institute. I also continue to be the main WW CFD SME at AWS so still work closely on helping AWS and Amazon teams on CFD-related matters. I also chair the Amazon-wide CFD Working group.",

In particular, he used the idea of light quanta (photons) to explain experimental results, but stressed the importance of the experimental results. The importance of his work on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921."
